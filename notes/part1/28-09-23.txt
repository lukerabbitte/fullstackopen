- Remember that hooks cannot be rendered conditionally

- React components are rendered first, then at an efficient time and with the minimal differences required, is given to the browser to paint.

- For small use cases where the UI is not re-rendered and we don't have to remember any state within the component, but just use it for a quick logical purposes,
we are totally allowed to use normal variables.

- To keep two similar components in sync, the right way to do this is lift their common state one layer up.
